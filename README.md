# RevitStuff
This is a temporary repo, which I will clean up later, that contains a collection of Revit scripts written for python.

To use as a button as originally designed, install pyRevit onto your computer. Otherwise write the code directly in the Python console within revit. This will also have to be downloaded and installed separately.
